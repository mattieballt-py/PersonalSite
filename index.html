              <button class="faq-question">You were at Red Bull Racing. Why did you leave? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>At 17, I wanted to design F1 cars. It's that instinct inside you to create that's such a strong drive to go out into the world and make the most ambitious, challenging thing. Red Bull taught me insane technical knowledge, and how to build in a team, working with others when every task needs doing immediately. I left to build Fibonacci because I'd rather build value for real people's businesses that makes tangible difference to the world, than perfect one component on a car to beat another car in a race.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">What did you actually do at Red Bull? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>"Powertrains Placement Engineer". Before university, aged 17, I was offered a rotational placement in the newly established Red Bull Powertrains, that rapidly grew from perhaps a hundred, to several hundred and a whole new building. I built and ran simulations on the new v6 power units, spent time in engine build designing and testing components, and learnt from absolute legends of the sport. The biggest lesson wasn't technical, it was that speed beats perfection. In F1, you iterate weekly. That's how I run Fibonacci now.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">Do you regret leaving? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>Not for a second. Red Bull was the best education I could've asked for, but I don't want to spend my 20s winning races I'm not driving. We get just one life, and I'd rather fail building my own thing than wonder "what if?". Of course I miss working with that incredible team though, but I'm building something like it with social media.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">Would you ever go back to F1 or engineering? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>The way I build websites, web design is engineering. I love mechanical and robotics, and I've done projects with clients for building hardware. You'll see in my videos that I'll build every chance I get, so we'll see... And once you have the racing bug, you've got it for life.</p></div>

              <button class="faq-question">You started a business at 13. How the hell did that happen? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>Luck, and a bit of mischief, got me into engineering early. I found friends that were smarter than me, and we asked ourselves "can we get companies to pay for us to build even cooler things?" 3D printing, materials, merch for a brand we wanted to build (the OG Fibonacci), we all tried to get businesses to fund. Started there, and went on a wild ride of learning skills, making things, Fibonacci was even an animation studio for about a year. But the missions still there, what problems can we solve for businesses? And overdelivering, always. Forever grateful for the brands that believed in us, and that now believe in me.</p></div>

              <button class="faq-question">Why did you revive it? What changed? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>I was at Imperial studying mechanical engineering, having worked at Red Bull, doing everything 'right', and I was bored. I missed owning something. So a year ago I brought Fibonacci back, but this time solo, consulting with startups on hardware projects and building full stack web apps. Then 6 months ago I looked at where the most value I've given to companies has been: the websites I built them on the side, hands down had the biggest financial return. That's when I pivoted to building websites.</p></div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">What happened to your cofounders? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>Over the years we've had perhaps 15 people be on the "Fibonacci HQ" team. The two I started with (I'd call them friends, but also cofounders I suppose), are doing incredible things in other fields, but stay in touch regularly to keep up with how the business is evolving. I still say "we" for the company, because for final reviews, security checks, and tech decisions, I do regularly outsource and have brilliant part time project employees.</p></div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">What's the long-term vision for Fibonacci? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>Right now? Build brilliant websites that deliver real results. It's so rewarding working for clients and local businesses I can meet with and get personally vested in their results. I want to transform the yachting industry specifically, because their marketing is terrible (sex sells and all that nonsense), and I love sailing. Long-term? I want Fibonacci to be the agency that makes luxury brands look as good online as they do in real life. With a team and brand that means more than just quality, but stands for something.</p></div>

              <button class="faq-question">Why yachting specifically? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>I sailed as a kid (imagining I was Jack Sparrow at a pirate wheel helm on a 32ft), and for my university yachting society, I spend hours going through yachting sites for booking trips. I find it insane that brokerage platforms, and marina websites that look like they were built in 2008. These are multi-million-pound boats with world-class engineering, and their websites feel like an afterthought. It's such an opportunity for shifting the industry to take advantage of the global trend to valuing access and experiences over ownership. Yachting deserves the same level of craft online as it has on the water.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">Do you actually sail, or is this just marketing? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>Competitive sailor, and rower actually. Currently hold the Chiswick Regatta Women's Open XIII 1st place with my university rowing team, and I have my steers licence for the Thames. I love being out on the water, the adventure, even the miserable cold of it all. And got the racing bug through and through, love winning. Helps to be the customer when designing sites that need to get more bookings for yacht charters.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">What's wrong with current yacht websites? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>Three things: slow, outdated, and built for the owner's ego instead of the buyer. Most yacht sites have a video of a boat, 10 paragraphs about 'heritage,' and zero clear CTAs. Doesn't help that every single site uses the word "luxury". Meanwhile, the person browsing wants to know: Can I book it? What's the price? Where can it go? I build sites that answer those questions in 10 seconds, not 10 minutes (no buyer will stay searching on a site for that long). Quality doesn't mean complicated, it means effortless.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">What's next for you in the yachting world? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button>
              <div class="faq-answer"><p>Short-term: work with charter companies, brokerages, and marinas to give them sites that actually convert. April I'm racing in the universities BUCS race as bow, so improving my sailing skill. Long-term? I want to help shape how yachting evolves. Building big. Oh and transatlantic crossing the moment I'm confident I won't get my crew drowned.</p></div>
